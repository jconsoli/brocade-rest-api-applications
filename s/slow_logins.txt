# Creates a workbook named "Slow_Logins.xlsx" with the following two worksheets:
#
#   * All logins at 4G or lower but whose remote optics support a higher login
#     speed.
#
#   * All logins at a slower speed than the report optic supports.
#
# IMPORTANT NOTES:
#
# Assumes brcddbb.brcddb_project.add_custom_search_terms() has been called first
#
# This file is intended for use with the search.py application. All comments and blank
# lines are removed but otherwise this file must conform to JSON formatting rules. Run
# search.py -eh for detailed use of these data structures
